                  <p class="card-text">I started to learn about programming three years ago. When I started, it was a little bit difficult since I did not have experience, not only with coding but with computer at all. Now, after a few months of trying and discovering, I am glad to say that this is the introduction to my projects. Let's move on!.</p>

              First, I would like to highlight the tools and languages I have been working with. I have some experience working with python, just at a basic level. I have also been working for some time with HTML. But most importantly, I have been working with JavaScript and a little bit of NodeJS.

              Now, the first project I would like to present is a <a href="">bank system</a>, right now is works like a unique and global system, but I am currenty working on it so that it will includes creating an account by each user. Then, I recently worked on a project which I call a <a href="">petty list</a>, in which the main idea is for you to share some info about your pet. Some more features may come in the future.

              As I have been studying for around 6 months, I have been working and guiding a some projects that I would like to present. <a href="">Buy-now-pay-later</a> is a python project group activity, in which I was in charge of the main code, it is just something basic, but it works well. Try it in your <a href="">cmd</a>. Last but not least, I would like to present a project in which the main objective was to work with design, <a href="">here</a> you have it.

              To conclude, I would like to say that those projects might seem basic, and I recognize that there are a lot of things to improve. But honestly, I feel happy to see the little things I have done. I highly believe the best is yet to come, let's code more.
